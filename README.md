# XAI Tutorial

This XAI Tutorial offers a small introduction to the possibilities and capabilities of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence. The tutorial explains in simple language using a fictitious app that uses computer vision what an explanation of the AI system can look like. In detail, we introduce the notions of model cards and three different explainability concepts:

- Global explanations
- Local explanations
- Counterfactual explanations

In this interactive tutorial, the user will receive insight and knowledge about these concepts. The tutorial is meant as a starting point to use our XAI Method Finder to find a suitable XAI solution for their use case.
